# YuriyVim
Modified the neovim configuration based on lunarVim. Rewrote some of the functions of lunarVim, and detailed commenting of the which_key keys to make it easier to use. And integrated some new plugins, so that the overall functionality is more complete, in the development can be used instead of VSCode to edit and debug code.

## Install
First, you should make sure lunarVim has been installed.
for LunarVim, you can clone it by 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim.git
